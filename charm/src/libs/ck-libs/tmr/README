This is a triangle mesh refinement library,
and pgm.C is a (poor) example code.

1. Get charm from CVS or wherever.  Build FEM for your system.  For example,
   for me, I type:
   build FEM net-linux -g

The -g is for debugging.

2. cd net-linux/tmp/libs/ck-libs/tmr

3. Build the program and library with 'make'.

4. Run it with 'charmrun pgm +vp1'.  If everything is working,
it will run forever, refining the mesh.

5. You could also try using NetFEM to visualize it.  Download
netfem_client_linux_3.tgz from
http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/research/fem/netfem/.  Unzip and untar this.
In the resulting directory, there will be a bin dir with 'netfem'
binary in it.  First run the sample program in one window: 
charmrun pgm +vp1 ++server ++server-port 1234 

5b. Then run 'netfem' in another window.  A dialog box will pop up asking
for where your running your FEM program.  If you are on the same
machine, the default value should work: localhost:1234.

5c. A view window and a controller window will pop up.  Play around
with it.  Hit update repeatedly to see how the mesh is changing.
