This is a parallel data transfer program built on
the Charm++ FEM framework, collision library, and 
AMPI.  It's *NOT* a library yet; it's just a 
demo program; but it will eventually be a library
so I'm putting it here in ck-libs.

It reads in an old mesh and partitions it, reads in 
a new mesh and partitions it (both in pgm.C), 
uses collision detection to match up old and new,
sends data so the new data has all the corresponding
old data, and finally uses a conservative transfer
method to transfer cell-centered data from old to new
(all in paralleltransfer.C).

  pgm.C does basic setup and I/O.
  paralleltransfer.C does all communication.
  tetmesh.C is a mesh of 3d tets.
  cg3d.C are computational geometry utility routines.
  transfer.C is the glue that binds cg3d.C to paralleltransfer.C

There are also several serial testing routines:
  test_transfer.C tests out cg3d and transfer.C; you run it like
      > make test_transfer
      > ./test_transfer test_transfer_dir/src.noboite test_transfer_dir/dest.noboite 
Source Tetrahedral mesh: 15 tets, 11 points
Coordinate range: 
Destination Tetrahedral mesh: 479 tets, 130 points
Coordinate range: 
Transfer successful: total error 9.09e-13
