# Script to collect up all the source code needed
# to build "FEM_ALONE", a version of the FEM framework
# built on regular MPI, not Charm++'s AMPI.
#
# WARNING: This script probably will not work with 
#          the recent versions of FEM. To add the 
#          adjacency and modification operations
#	   it was required to use Charm++ instead
#          of the pure MPI base that had existed.
#
# Build charm normally, then run this script from the 
# main charm directory like:
#    > src/libs/ck-libs/fem/make_fem_alone.sh
#    > cd fem_alone
#
# You can now build the femalone library using your
# compiler, like:
#    > CC -c *.C -I. -DFEM_ALONE=1
#    > ar cr libfemalone.a *.o
#
# This could also be integrated into your build script.
#
#
# Because FEM still depends on a few charm++ utilities
# (pup, CkHashtable, CkVec), and the charm++ configuration
# headers (conv-config, for e.g., fortran name mangling),
# we need to copy over this strange subset of files.
# At runtime, all you need is libfemalone.a.
