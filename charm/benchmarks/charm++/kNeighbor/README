The kNeighbor microbenchmark which enhances the pingpong test by considering 
the message contention. In each iteration, each element (usually one element 
per core) will send and receive a message from its K neighbor cores on both 
sides (in wraparound mode). The output tells how long each iteration takes.

Usage:
These args must be specified in the following order:

<#elements> : is forced to be equal to #pes
<#iterations> : number of iterations the test will run for
<msg size> : the message size each element sends it to it's neighbors
