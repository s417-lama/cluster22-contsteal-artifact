   This test is to demonstrate a race condition in the SMP build of
   charm++.

   Main launches a batch of Array and Group in a loop.
   
   The Array and group each engage in a ring and complete by reporting
   to main.  Main will not start on the new batch until all elements
   of the previous batch complete.
   
   This test is expected to hang in SMP mode if the bug is present.

   By default a periodic timeout is registered which will trigger an abort
   if the number of batches doesn't progress between periods. 

   We do not construct the group or array inside main because the
   CkAllocSysMsg race condition only affects group construction in
   parallel execution.

   The array must be multidimensional so that its indices will have
   non zero values 

   For sample usage, see make test.
