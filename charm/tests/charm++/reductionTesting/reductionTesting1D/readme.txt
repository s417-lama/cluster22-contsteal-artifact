This program tests the section reduction functionality for array sections in Charm++ and smp.

**
** How to run this program
**
*******/
The program takes in two parameters, in the following order:
arrayDimesion and vectorSize respectively.

arrayDimesion -- dimension of the 1D chare array.
vectorSize -- Each element of the 1D chare array, has a vector of doubles over which reduction is performed.
			  This variable defines the size of the vector. Each vector element is initialized to its index value.
reductionTesting1D -- executable

So, for example, if you want to create a 20 chare array with a vector size of 5, you could do the following:
	%./charmrun +n4 +ppn8 ./reductionTesting1D 20 5

Here's a control flow of this program:

Input from user(arrayDimensions X, vectorSize)
				|
				|
				V
Create an 1D chare array (Test1D) of the given dimension.
Each chare element has a vector of size vectorSize, each element of which is
initialized to it's (the element's) index.
				|
				|
				V
Create an array of Section Proxies.
//Random things that I decided, in order create the section proxies.
Number of array section proxies that will be created = arrayDimension
				|
				|
				V
Each section proxy does a Multicast (calls Test1D::compute(msg)).
A message is sent to the compute entry, which essentially helps to identify which sectoion Proxy
are we dealing with, on the receiving end.
				|
				|
				V
The compute entry, essentially reduces the vector elements and callbacks to Main::reportSum.
