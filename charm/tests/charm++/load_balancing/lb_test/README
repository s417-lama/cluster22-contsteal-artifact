		      Load Balancing Framework Test Program
================================================================================

This program can be used to test various strategies for load balancing. The
basic configuration is an array of elements which do some computation, and then
send a "compute" message to ther neighbors. Three different topologies are
possible which test different communication patterns: 1D linear ring, 2D
stencil or mesh and a random irregular graph.
