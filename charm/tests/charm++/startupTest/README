Test initialization order.

Readonly variables before Groups and Arrays.

Groups before Arrays.

Boundto arrays are constructed before their shadows in bound arrays.

Groups are constructed in group ID order.

Arrays constructed in array ID order.

Arguments: arrSize WasteUnits validateBoundOrder
 Where:
	 arrsize   : representing the number of array elements per array
	 arrsize2  : representing the number of array elements in the second dimension
	 wasteunit : >0.0 representing cputime to waste when doing work
	 validate  : is 1 or 0 to enable testing of construction order in bound arrays

 Typically: startupTest 100 0.001 1
