* updated autoconf and Makefile to accept build options
* created AMPI all passing testlist automatic generation script (based on original runtests) "generate_ampi_testlist" Usage:
	./generate_ampi_testlist -tests=testlist -xmlfile=summary.xml
	This will run mpich test suites with AMPI and save all passing and non-timeout (60s) tests to testlist.ampi in the toplevel build directory.
	Verify changes and commit/push updated testlist.ampi as needed.
* build AMPI with flag "--enable-ampi-mpich-tests" will enable AMPI test automation with mpich test suites
	once seeing the flag, autoconfig sets compiler macro AMPI_ERRHANDLER_RETURN = 1 and the Makefile macro BUILD_MPICH_TESTS:=true
* running "make test" with TESTOPTS in tests/ampi will automatically configure, compile and run all tests including mpich-tests using AMPI

To manually configure the mpich-3.2 test suite to use AMPI, do:

./configure.sh
