INTRODUCTION

This is a 2D crack propagation application built on top of the
FEM framework. It is a fully functional analysis application,
and includes input, partitioning, and processing.  There is no
output for now, however.


BUILD

In order to compile the crack2d program, you need to just type "make"
in this directory. This will make one program: pgm, the parallel
crack2d application.

There is also a serial version of the exact same program, which
can be made by typing "make serial".

The files in this directory include the input files:
    cohesive.inp: Main configuration file--timestep and materials
    crck_bar.inp: Mesh input file--lists nodes and elements

The common I/O and physics files:
    config.C: Read configuration file
    mesh.C: Read and set up nodes and elements 
    node.C: Physics for node timestepping
    lst_coh2.C: Physics for cohesive elements
    lst_NL.C: Physics for volumetric elements
    crack.h: Main header file

The FEM framework version files:
    fem_main.C: FEM version's main routine
    fem_mesh.C: Interfaces mesh with FEM framework

The serial version files:
    serial_main.C: Serial version of fem_main.C


RUN

# This will run the program pgm on 2 processors, by mapping 4 partitions
# onto these two processors. This program runs for 2000 iterations, and
# prints the time taken for each iteration at the end. Migration is
# performed after every 25 iterations. Note that the number of iterations can
# be changed in the cohesive.inp file.

./charmrun +p2 pgm +vp4

I have bigger data files available for this program. SO, if you are interested
in using those, you should contact me. (They are so big, I dont want to
check them in this directory.)
