Demo for delegated cross-array sections.

Test creates one or more chare arrays and creates a cross-array section that
includes chares from each of these chare arrays. Section members are pinged
via a multicast and then participate in a hello world.

Multicasts to the section are delegated to the CkMulticast library.
