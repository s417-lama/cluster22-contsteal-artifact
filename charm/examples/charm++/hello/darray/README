Hello World in Charm with a Chare Array.

Demonstrates basic chare array creation and use, but with the added
twist of dynamically creating the elements in a chare object outside
main.  The Hi message is passed along the array from 0th to Nth.
Illustrates output nondeterminism as an interesting side effect.
