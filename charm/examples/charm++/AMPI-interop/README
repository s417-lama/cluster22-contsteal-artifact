This is a 'proof of concept' example program showing AMPI + Charm++
  interoperation. It runs with virtualization in both the number of
  chares and AMPI ranks.

Warning: This functionality is experimental and may not be production-ready.

To build:
  $ make

To run:
  $ ./charmrun +p <numPEs> ./hello <numChares> +vp <numRanks>

For example:
  $ ./charmrun +p4 ./hello 8 +vp8 ++local
