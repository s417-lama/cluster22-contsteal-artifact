TO COMPILE-
Do a make in this folder

TO RUN-
Either provide no arguments or provide all
./charmrun +p<Procs> ./leanmd <dimX,dimY,dimZ,steps>
Example - ./charmrun +p4 ./leanmd 2 2 2 1001 
Example - ./charmrun +p4 ./leanmd 2 2 2 1001 

READ ORDER
leanmd.ci - contains the most important aspects of the program, look for run() 
function for each chare which is called right after constructor call for each
chare. It contains most of the parallel flow and control flow information.

Cell.* - contains the implementation of important functions attached with
Cell; focus on sendPositions() and updateProperties()

Compute.* - contains the implementation for Compute; the interact() function
is important as it does the force computation.

Main.* - contains the constructor for Main chare; also the starting point 
of the application; main chare passes control to run() of Main chare and
constructors of Cell.

physics.h - contains physics equation implementation for force computation; also
contains the contribute for reduction of forces.

defs.h - #define for constant values and some class declaration
