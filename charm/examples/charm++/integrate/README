Simple integration in Charm++.

Parameters are the number of slices and the number of chares.  Where
the former should be an even multiple of the latter.

Demonstrates basic problem decomposition in an chare array
context. Work is divided up evenly across the chares and each one
calculates the results for its slice and passes the result to the
mainproxy.
