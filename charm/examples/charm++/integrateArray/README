Simple integration in Charm++ with reduction.

Parameters are the number of slices and the number of chares.  Where
the former should be an even multiple of the latter.

Demonstrates basic problem decomposition in an chare array context and
using a reduction to capture results. Work is divided up evenly across
the chares and each one calculates the results for its slice and the
total is accumulated in a global reduction.
