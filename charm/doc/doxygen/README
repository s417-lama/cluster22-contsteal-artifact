Doxygen comes with Redhat7.2 and has already been installed on all new group Linux machines.

Here is the steps for generating config file:

1) doxygen -g <config>  --> generates config file

2) vi <config>  --> change some settings

3) doxygen <config>  --> actually build the docs

Here charm.conf is a sample config file that reads the current 
charm, to generate HTML documentation in html/.

Type "make install" to copy this HTML onto the 
main website, at /www/doxygen.

src/ contains doxygen-specific "source code",
like the doxygen main page.
